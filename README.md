# MY MART
My Unit 2 construct week project.

Hi there, Myself Ritesh Ranjan ,currently we had a interesting Construct week at Masai School .
Basically , the construct week comes at the end of our units during which we use all the concepts learnt during the unit to create viable products and prove out mettle.
This construct week(Unit 2) I got the project to clone Modesens.com which is a fashionwear website so i took inspiration from the website and created MY MART.


THE PROCESS AND PRODUCT:-
So ,I divided the website into small parts like signup page, login page, dashboard, a shopping page and of course the cart. I tried to provide as much functionality to the page as
possible with alerts and the basic black and white theme of the original website. Also i provided applicable coupons which can be used to get some profits on the final purchase in
the cart.


TOOLS USED:-
The tools used for the project were HTML, JS ,CSS.
The IDE use was VS code and finally the GIT extension was GITHUB.


CONCLUSION:-
The construct week is a fun time we get to used all the skills we have learnt so far and see it taking shape into some beautiful and viable outcomes.
I have provide the Git link for the project so do check it out.

//#Working of the project :
 run the index.html file to ented the signup page and from there the whole file will become accessible.

Thank You.
